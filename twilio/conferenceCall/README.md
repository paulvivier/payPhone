Conference Call

Variation on Paul's Joke Bot, which uses nodejs, npm, a machine you have priviledges to run a server on, and the ability to open/set port numbers. This application will initiate a phone call with two other participants (probably extendable to more). At a minimum, this will suffice for a two-way phone conversation. 


- Install nodejs 
- Runs on :8080 by default. Change Port# in config.js
- Set your Twilio ENV variables to match the config.js environment variables. If you're running bash, you can do this in ~/.bashrc
- Package does not include node_module folder. 
  You will need to run 'nodejs install' to get the latest version of dependencies.
- Execute with 'nodejs app.js
- This makes my first real README.md on GitHub. Kind of excited about that.
